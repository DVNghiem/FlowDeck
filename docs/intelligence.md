# FlowDeck Intelligence Features

FlowDeck's intelligence layer adds safety-first AI editing, persistent architecture memory, and risk prediction directly into every OpenCode session. These features require no extra setup beyond running `/fd-new-project`.

## Slash Commands

### Change Impact Radar

Predicts which files, modules, APIs, tests, and database paths are likely to be affected before the AI edits anything.

Use `/fd-suggest` or `/fd-translate-intent` when you need pre-change analysis with impact context.

**Arguments:**
- `--change` — describe the proposed change (free text)
- `--scope` — `all` (default), `api`, `db`, `tests`
- `--json` — machine-readable JSON output

**Output:** Table showing researcher/architect/tester agent roles, known hotspots, and recommended traversal scope.

---

### Blast Radius Preview

Shows the likely downstream consequences of a proposed change — hidden dependencies, fragile integration points, and predicted test breakages.

Use `/fd-suggest` for broad risk discovery and `/fd-deploy-check` before release changes.

**Arguments:**
- `--change` — describe the proposed change
- `--depth` — dependency traversal hops (default: `2`)
- `--json` — JSON output

**How it works:** Reads Repo Memory Graph for dependency edges. Cross-references recurring failure patterns from Failure Replay Engine. Spawns architect + researcher + tester agent team.

---

### `/fd-translate-intent`

Converts a vague request like "make checkout faster" into concrete, ranked implementation options with tradeoffs **before** any code is written.

```
/fd-translate-intent --intent "make checkout faster"
/fd-translate-intent --intent "reduce memory usage on the worker"
```

**Arguments:**
- `--intent` — the high-level intent to translate (required)
- `--json` — JSON output

---

### Volatility Map

Displays the Codebase Volatility Map — highlights unstable zones based on churn, hotfix frequency, and unresolved TODO clusters.

Use the `volatility-map` tool directly from delegated agents for incremental updates.

**Arguments:**
- `--threshold` — minimum stability level to show: `stable`, `moderate`, `volatile` (default), `critical`
- `--limit` — max results
- `--json` — JSON output

**Populated by:** `/fd-map-codebase` writes initial data; the `volatility-map` tool allows incremental updates.

---

### Regression Prediction

Estimates the most likely regression categories for a change — performance, auth, schema, UI states, async flows, etc.

FlowDeck derives regression risk from historical failures plus volatility data during analysis-oriented workflows.

**Arguments:**
- `--change` — describe the proposed change
- `--categories` — comma-separated from: `performance`, `auth`, `schema`, `ui-state`, `async-flow`, `api-contract`, `data-integrity`, `security`, `config`, `i18n` (default: `all`)
- `--json` — JSON output

---

### Test Gap Detector

Identifies which areas of a proposed change are weakly covered by tests, and suggests the minimum high-value tests to add first.

Use `/fd-verify` and `/fd-deploy-check` for current test-gap surfacing in production workflows.

**Arguments:**
- `--change` — describe the proposed change
- `--scope` — `unit`, `integration`, `e2e`, `all` (default)
- `--json` — JSON output

---

### Human Review Routing

Routes risky patches to the right reviewer type — security, backend, infra, domain-owner, frontend, data, or devops — based on the file paths and change description.

Routing to reviewer profiles is integrated into verification and deployment checks.

**Arguments:**
- `--files` — comma-separated file paths being changed
- `--change` — describe the change
- `--json` — JSON output

**Routing rules:**
- `security` — auth, token, password, crypto, JWT, RBAC, XSS, SQL keywords; always added for high-risk patches
- `backend` — API, route, controller, migration keywords
- `infra` — Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD keywords
- `domain-owner` — billing, payment, checkout, subscription keywords
- `frontend` — component, CSS, React, Vue keywords
- `data` — schema, migration, index, constraint keywords
- `devops` — pipeline, YAML workflow, cron, schedule keywords

---

## Automatic Hooks

These run on every `write` or `edit` tool call with no manual trigger needed.

### Patch Trust Score

Every AI-generated write/edit is scored 0–100:

| Score | Verdict | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| ≥ 80 | `safe` | Auto-apply |
| 40–79 | `review-required` | Logged with signals |
| < 40 | `high-risk` | Warning printed, human review required |

**Risk signals checked:**
- File is in a `critical` volatility zone (−40 pts)
- File is in a `volatile` zone (−25 pts)
- File has moderate churn (−10 pts)
- File has prior failure history in FAILURES.json (−20 pts)
- Edit content contains high-risk keywords: password, secret, token, auth, crypto, jwt, etc. (−8 pts each, max −30 pts)

### Safe Execution Modes

Automatically selects the editing mode for the session:

| Mode | When Used |
|------|-----------|
| `auto-edit` | Trust score ≥ 60, low volatility |
| `guarded` | Trust score 30–59, or moderate volatility |
| `review-only` | Trust score < 30, or config override |

Override by setting `execution_mode` in `.planning/config.json`:
```json
{ "execution_mode": "review-only" }
```

### Architectural Constraint Guard

Before any write or edit, FlowDeck reads `.codebase/CONSTRAINTS.md` and blocks writes to any path listed under `## Forbidden Paths`.

**Example `.codebase/CONSTRAINTS.md`:**
```markdown
## Forbidden Paths
- src/legacy/
- infra/production/
- db/migrations/
```

### Decision Trace Hook

Every write or edit automatically appends a minimal entry to `.codebase/DECISIONS.jsonl` recording the tool name, file path, and timestamp. For full entries with rationale, use the `decision-trace` tool explicitly.

---

## Persistent State Tools

These tools manage the `.codebase/` directory and can be called directly by agents.

### `repo-memory`

Manages `.codebase/MEMORY.json` — a persistent graph of modules, services, APIs, schemas, and their relationships.

**Actions:** `read`, `write_node`, `query`, `delete_node`

**Example:**
```
repo-memory action=write_node node_id=auth-module node={type:module, path:src/auth, owner:alice, tags:[auth,security], ...}
repo-memory action=query query={type:module, owner:alice}
```

### `failure-replay`

Manages `.codebase/FAILURES.json` — a log of reverted commits, failed deployments, flaky tests, and bug fixes.

**Actions:** `record`, `query`, `list`, `mark_resolved`

**Example:**
```
failure-replay action=record entry={id:deploy-001, type:failed_deployment, description:"...", affected_paths:[src/auth], tags:[auth]}
failure-replay action=query query={path_prefix:src/auth}
```

### `decision-trace`

Manages `.codebase/DECISIONS.jsonl` — append-only log of why every change was made.

**Actions:** `record`, `query`, `get_for_file`

**Fields:** `file_path`, `change_type`, `rationale`, `evidence[]`, `assumptions[]`, `alternatives_considered[]`, `risk_level`

### `volatility-map`

Manages `.codebase/VOLATILITY.json` — per-file churn and stability data.

**Actions:** `read`, `write`, `query_hotspots`, `update_entry`

**Stability labels:** `stable` → `moderate` → `volatile` → `critical` (computed from churn score + hotfix count + TODO count)

### `policy-engine`

Manages `.codebase/POLICIES.json` — self-healing editing rules that update after repeated failures.

**Actions:** `list`, `add`, `record_violation`, `toggle`, `query`
